# DL4CV project: Underwater Color Restoration for Videos

## Networks in use
- [blue_filter](https://li-chongyi.github.io/proj_underwater_image_synthesis.html) - a filter that simulates underwater degradation for images, using depth map.
- [UWCNN](https://li-chongyi.github.io/proj_underwater_image_synthesis.html) - color restoration for UW images; from the same paper as above.
- [colorization_network](https://github.com/zhangmozhe/Deep-Exemplar-based-Video-Colorization) - network for a temporal-consistant colorization of grayscale videos
- [depth_estimation](https://robust-cvd.github.io/) - network for temporal-consistant colorization of grayscale videos.
